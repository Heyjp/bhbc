She's a disgusting pig, right? I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no \"tapes\" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website.\n\nLook at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! I know words. I have the best words. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.\n\nDoes everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.\n\nI will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.\n\nI'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.
